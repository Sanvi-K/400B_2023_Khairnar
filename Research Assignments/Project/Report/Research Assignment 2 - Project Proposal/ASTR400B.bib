   abstract = {We study the future orbital evolution and merging of the Milky Way (MW)-M31-M33 system, using a combination of collisionless N-body simulations and semi-analytic orbit integrations. Monte Carlo simulations are used to explore the consequences of varying all relevant initial phase-space and mass parameters within their observational uncertainties. The observed M31 transverse velocity from Papers I and II implies that the MW and M31 will merge t = 5.86 +1.61-0.72 Gyr from now. The first pericenter occurs at t = 3.87+0.42-0.32 Gyr, at a pericenter distance of r = 31.0+38.0-19.8 kpc. In 41% of Monte Carlo orbits, M31 makes a direct hit with the MW, defined here as a first-pericenter distance less than 25 kpc. For the M31-M33 system, the first-pericenter time and distance are t = 0.85+0.18-0.13 Gyr and r = 80.8+42.2-31.7 kpc. By the time M31 gets to its first pericenter with the MW, M33 is close to its second pericenter with M31. For the MW-M33 system, the first-pericenter time and distance are t = 3.70+0.74-0.46 Gyr and r = 176.0+239.0-136.9 kpc. The most likely outcome is for the MW and M31 to merge first, with M33 settling onto an orbit around them that may decay toward a merger later. However, there is a 9% probability that M33 makes a direct hit with the MW at its first pericenter, before M31 gets to or collides with the MW. Also, there is a 7% probability that M33 gets ejected from the Local Group, temporarily or permanently. The radial mass profile of the MW-M31 merger remnant is significantly more extended than the original profiles of either the MW or M31, and suggests that the merger remnant will resemble an elliptical galaxy. The Sun will most likely (85% probability) end up at a larger radius from the center of the MW-M31 merger remnant than its current distance from the MW center, possibly further than 50 kpc (10% probability). There is a 20% probability that the Sun will at some time in the next 10 Gyr find itself moving through M33 (within 10 kpc), but while dynamically still bound to the MW-M31 merger remnant. The arrival and possible collision of M31 (and possibly M33) with the MW is the next major cosmic event affecting the environment of our Sun and solar system that can be predicted with some certainty. © 2012 The American Astronomical Society.

   abstract = {A growing number of low luminosity and low surface brightness astronomical objects challenge traditional notions of both galaxies and star clusters. To address this, we propose a definition of galaxy independent of the cold dark matter model of the universe: A galaxy is a gravitationally bound set of stars whose properties cannot be explained by a combination of baryons and Newton's laws of gravity. After exploring observational diagnostics of this definition, we examine the classification of ultra-faint dwarfs, globular clusters, ultra-compact dwarfs, and tidal dwarfs. While kinematic studies provide an effective galaxy diagnostic in many regimes, they can be less useful for compact or faint systems. To explore the use of [Fe/H] spread as a complementary diagnostic, we use published spectroscopic [Fe/H] measurements of 16 Milky Way dwarfs and 24 globular clusters to calculate their [Fe/H] spreads and uncertainties. Our principal results are: (i) no old star cluster less luminous then M_V = -10 has a significant (> 0.1 dex) spread in iron; (ii) known ultra-faint dwarfs can be classified with a combination of kinematics and [Fe/H]; (iii) the observed [Fe/H] spreads in massive (> 10^6 M_Sun) globular clusters do not necessarily imply they are the stripped nuclei of dwarfs, nor a need for dark matter; and (iv) if ultra-compact dwarfs reside in dark matter halos akin to those of ultra-faint dwarfs of the same half-light radii, then they will show no clear dynamical signature of dark matter. We suggest measurements that may assist future classification of massive globular clusters, ultra-compact dwarfs, and ultra-faint galaxies. Our galaxy definition is designed to be independent of the details of current observations and models, while our proposed diagnostics can be refined or replaced as our understanding of the universe evolves.},

   abstract = {Mergers are predicted in all cosmological models involving cold dark matter (CDM) to be one of the dominant channels whereby galaxies accrete mass. In this paper, we present a detailed analysis of predicted galaxy-galaxy merger fractions and rates in the Millennium simulation and compare these with the most up to date observations of the same quantities up to z ∼ 3. We carry out our analysis by considering the predicted merger history in the Millennium simulation within a given time interval, as a function of stellar mass. This method, as opposed to pair fraction counts, considers mergers that have already taken place, and allows a more direct comparison with the observed rates and fractions measured with the concentration-asymmetry-clumpiness (CAS) method. We examine the evolution of the predicted merger fraction and rate in the Millennium simulation for galaxies with stellar masses M* ∼ 109-1012 M⊙. We find that the predicted merger rates and fractions match the observations well for galaxies with M * > 1011 M⊙ at z < 2, while significant discrepancies occur at lower stellar masses, and at z > 2 for M* > 1011 M⊙ systems. At z > 2, the simulations underpredict the observed merger fractions by a factor of 4-10. The shape of the predicted merger fraction and rate evolutions are similar to the observations up to z ∼ 2, and peak at 1 < z < 2 in almost all mass bins. The exception is the merger rate of galaxies with M* > 1011 M⊙, which remains high at z < 1.5. We discuss possible reasons for these discrepancies, and compare different realizations of the Millennium simulation to understand the effect of varying the physical implementation of feedback. We conclude that the comparison is potentially affected by a number of issues, including uncertainties in interpreting the observations and simulations in terms of the assumed merger mass ratios and merger time-scales. The differences between the observations and simulation results might also be due to problems in the modelling of star formation in the simulation, which produces redder and less biased galaxies than observed, particularly for galaxies with stellar masses M* < 1011 M⊙. Finally, our findings may also be related to other CDM problems, including the lack of massive galaxies with M* > 1011 M⊙ at z > 1, and a lack of merger events between lower mass galaxies. © 2009 RAS.},

   abstract = {The evolution and distribution of the angular momentum of dark matter (DM) halos have been discussed in several studies over the past decades. In particular, the idea arose that angular momentum conservation should allow us to infer the total angular momentum of the entire DM halo from measuring the angular momentum of the baryonic component, which is populating the center of the halo, especially for disk galaxies. To test this idea and to understand the connection between the angular momentum of the DM halo and its galaxy, we use a state-of-the-art, hydrodynamical cosmological simulation taken from the set of Magneticum Pathfinder simulations. Thanks to the inclusion of the relevant physical processes, the improved underlying numerical methods, and high spatial resolution, we successfully produce populations of spheroidal and disk galaxies self-consistently. Thus, we are able to study the dependence of galactic properties on their morphology. We find that (1) the specific angular momentum of stars in disk and spheroidal galaxies as a function of their stellar mass compares well with observational results; (2) the specific angular momentum of the stars in disk galaxies is slightly smaller compared to the specific angular momentum of the cold gas, in good agreement with observations; (3) simulations including the baryonic component show a dichotomy in the specific stellar angular momentum distribution when splitting the galaxies according to their morphological type (this dichotomy can also be seen in the spin parameter, where disk galaxies populate halos with slightly larger spin compared to spheroidal galaxies); (4) disk galaxies preferentially populate halos in which the angular momentum vector of the DM component in the central part shows a better alignment to the angular momentum vector of the entire halo; and (5) the specific angular momentum of the cold gas in disk galaxies is approximately 40% smaller than the specific angular momentum of the total DM halo and shows a significant scatter.},

   abstract = {We examine the effect of different dark matter halo potentials on the morphology and kinematics of tidal tails in a merger model of NGC 7252. We find that models of merging galaxies with low halo masses of M h  ∼ 4-8 M disk+bulge (M db ) can fit the observed morphology and kinematics of the NGC 7252 tails, while galaxies with high-mass halos (M h  ∼ 16-32 M db ) fail in this respect. In high-mass models, the deep potential only allows weakly bound disk material (stars or gas) at R ≳ 5 disk scale lengths to be ejected in tidal tails that tend to fall back onto the parent galaxies before the final merger. Galaxies with massive, low-density halos are somewhat more successful at ejecting tidal debris during mergers, but they still have difficulties recreating the thin, gas-rich tails observed in NGC 7252. Our models suggest upper limits for the dark halo masses in the NGC 7252 progenitor galaxies of roughly M h  ≲ 10 M db . We note, however, that our calculations have focused on the rather idealized case of the isolated merging of galaxies with distinct dark matter halos; calculations that employ more realistic ("cosmological") initial conditions are needed to fully explore the use of tidal tails in constraining dark matter in galaxies. © 1998.

Allowing for a comparable amount of diffuse mass to fill the volume of the Local Group, we find that the two galaxies are likely to collide in a few billion years - within the Sun's lifetime. During the interaction, there is a chance that the Sun will be pulled away from its present orbital radius and reside in an extended tidal tail. The likelihood for this outcome increases as the merger progresses, and there is a remote possibility that our Sun will be more tightly bound to Andromeda than to the Milky Way before the final merger. Eventually, after the merger has completed, the Sun is most likely to be scattered to the outer halo and reside at much larger radii (>30 kpc). The density profiles of the stars, gas and dark matter in the merger product resemble those of elliptical galaxies. Our Local Group model therefore provides a prototype progenitor of late-forming elliptical galaxies. © 2008 RAS.},

   abstract = {We use a large cosmological N-body simulation to study the origin of possible correlations between the merging history and spin of cold dark matter haloes. In particular, we examine claims that remnants of major mergers tend to have higher-than-average spins, and find that the effect is driven largely by unrelaxed systems: equilibrium dark matter haloes show no significant correlation between spin and merging history. Out-of-equilibrium haloes have, on average, higher spin than relaxed systems, suggesting that the virialization process leads to a net decrease in the value of the spin parameter. We find that this decrease is due to the internal redistribution of mass and angular momentum that occurs during virialization. This process is especially efficient during major mergers, when high angular momentum material is pushed beyond the virial radius of the remnant. Because such redistribution likely affects the angular momentum of baryons and dark matter unevenly, our findings question the common practice of identifying the specific angular momentum content of a halo with that of its embedded luminous component. Further work is needed to elucidate the true relation between the angular momentum content of baryons and dark matter in galaxy systems assembled hierarchically. © 2007 The Authors.

   abstract = {We use numerical simulations to study the kinematic structure of remnants formed from mergers of equal-mass disk galaxies. In particular, we show that remnants of dissipational mergers, which include the radiative cooling of gas, star formation, feedback from supernovae, and the growth of supermassive black holes, are smaller, rounder, have, on average, a larger central velocity dispersion, and show significant rotation compared to remnants of dissipationless mergers. The increased rotation speed of dissipational remnants owes its origin to star formation that occurs in the central regions during the galaxy merger. We have further quantified the anisotropy, three-dimensional shape, minor-axis rotation, and isophotal shape of each merger remnant, finding that dissipational remnants are more isotropic, closer to oblate, have the majority of their rotation along their major axis, and are more disky than dissipationless remnants. Individual remnants display a wide variety of kinematic properties. A large fraction of the dissipational remnants are oblate isotropic rotators. Many dissipational remnants, and all of the dissipationless ones, are slowly rotating and anisotropic. The remnants of gas-rich major mergers can well reproduce the observed distribution of projected ellipticities, rotation parameter (V/σ)*, kinematic misalignments, ψ, and isophotal shapes. The dissipationless remnants are a poor match to this data. We also investigate the properties of merger remnants as a function of initial disk gas fraction, orbital angular momentum, and the mass of the progenitor galaxies. Our results support the merger hypothesis for the origin of low-luminosity elliptical galaxies provided that the progenitor disks are sufficiently gas-rich, however our remnants are a poor match to the bright ellipticals that are slowly rotating and uniformly boxy. © 2006.

   abstract = {Several lines of evidence suggest that as dark matter haloes grow their scale radius increases, and that the density in their central region drops. Major mergers seem an obvious mechanism to explain both these phenomena, and the resulting patterns in the concentration-mass- redshift relation. To test this possibility, we have simulated equal-mass mergers between haloes with a variety of cosmological density profiles, placed on various different orbits. The remnants typically have higher densities than the initial conditions, but differ only slightly from self-similar scaling predictions. They are reasonably well fit by Einasto profiles, but have parameters distinct from those of the initial conditions. The net internal energy available to the merger remnant, relative to the internal energy of the initial conditions, κ, has the greatest influence on the properties of the final mass distribution. As expected, energetic encounters produce more extended remnants while mergers of strongly bound systems produce compact remnants. Surprisingly, however, the scale radius of the density profile shows the opposite trend, increasing in the remnants of low-energy encounters relative to energetic ones. Also even in the most energetic encounters, the density within the scale radius decreases only slightly (by 10-20 per cent), while for very low-energy systems it increases significantly after the merger.We conclude that while major mergers can produce remnants that are more diffuse at large radii, they are relatively ineffective at changing the central densities of haloes, and seem unlikely to explain the mean trends in the concentration-mass-redshift relation.},

The outcomes of mergers are most easily understood in terms of a scaled dimensionless energy parameter κ and an angular momentum (or spin) parameter λ.We find that the axial ratio c/a scales roughly linearly with energy κ while the axial ratio c/b scales linearly with spin λ. Qualitatively, mergers on radial orbits produce prolate remnants, while mergers on tangential orbits produce oblate remnants. The spin of the remnant can be predicted from angular momentum conservation, while the overall size changes as ∼κ -5, as expected from self-similar scaling at constant mean density.We discuss potential cosmological applications for these simple patterns.},

@article{Abadi2010,
   abstract = {We use N-body/gasdynamical cosmological simulations to examine the effect of the assembly of a central galaxy on the shape and mass profile of its surrounding dark matter halo. Two series of simulations are compared; one that follows only the evolution of the dark matter component of individual haloes in the proper Λcold dark matter (ΛCDM) cosmological context, and a second series where a baryonic component is added and followed hydrodynamically. The simulations with baryons include radiative cooling but neglect the formation of stars and their feedback. The efficient, unimpeded cooling that results leads most baryons to collect at the halo centre in a centrifugally supported disc which, due to angular momentum losses, is too small and too massive when compared with typical spiral galaxies. This admittedly unrealistic model allows us, nevertheless, to gauge the maximum effect that galaxies may have in transforming their surrounding dark haloes. We find, in agreement with earlier work, that the shape of the halo becomes more axisymmetric: post galaxy assembly, haloes are transformed from triaxial into essentially oblate systems, with well-aligned isopotential contours of roughly constant flattening (〈/a〉∼ 0.85). Haloes always contract as a result of galaxy assembly, but the effect is substantially less pronounced than predicted by the traditional 'adiabatic-contraction' hypothesis. The reduced contraction helps to reconcile ΛCDM haloes with constraints on the dark matter content inside the solar circle and should alleviate the longstanding difficulty of matching simultaneously the scaling properties of galaxy discs and the galaxy luminosity function. The halo contraction we report is also less pronounced than found in earlier simulations, a disagreement which suggests that halo contraction is not solely a function of the initial and final distribution of baryons. Not only how much baryonic mass has been deposited at the centre of a halo matters, but also the mode of its deposition. Although simple formulae might work in particular cases where galaxies form nearly adiabatically, in general it might prove impossible to predict the halo response to galaxy formation without a detailed understanding of a galaxy's detailed assembly history. © 2010 The Authors.

@article{Wechsler2018,
   abstract = {In our modern understanding of galaxy formation, every galaxy forms within a dark matter halo. The formation and growth of galaxies over time is connected to the growth of the halos in which they form. The advent of large galaxy surveys as well as high-resolution cosmological simulations has provided a new window into the statistical relationship between galaxies and halos and its evolution. Here, we define this galaxy-halo connection as the multivariate distribution of galaxy and halo properties that can be derived from observations and simulations. This galaxy-halo connection provides a key test of physical galaxy-formation models; it also plays an essential role in constraints of cosmological models using galaxy surveys and in elucidating the properties of dark matter using galaxies. We review techniques for inferring the galaxy-halo connection and the insights that have arisen from these approaches. Some things we have learned are that galaxy-formation efficiency is a strong function of halo mass; at its peak in halos around a pivot halo mass of 10 12 M , less than 20% of the available baryons have turned into stars by the present day; the intrinsic scatter in galaxy stellar mass is small, less than 0.2 dex at a given halo mass above this pivot mass; below this pivot mass galaxy stellar mass is a strong function of halo mass; the majority of stars over cosmic time were formed in a narrow region around this 435 pivot mass. We also highlight key open questions about how galaxies and halos are connected, including understanding the correlations with secondary properties and the connection of these properties to galaxy clustering.},
